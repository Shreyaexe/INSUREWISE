Living Benefit to Policyholders, a paradigm shift in Life Insurance in Nepal
Policyholders may bundle Critical Illness rider and obtain coverage of up to Rs. 50 lakhs as part of their life insurance plan along with other benefits. Critical Illness coverage, therefore, is a living benefit i.e. a benefit that is paid out although the policyholder is alive. As per the coverage was taken by the policyholder (up to Rs. 50 lakhs) a payout is made to the policyholder if the policyholder is diagnosed with any of the above conditions.
In order to ensure that the policyholders are provided adequate financial support at the time of need, the payout is made against the medical condition, not medical bills. This provides the policyholder real support at the time of need reducing the financial strain on the overall family and to the patient/policyholder also.

Saving a Life doesn’t require a Life’s Savings.
Life insurance amongst other benefits also is known as an instrument to safeguard the future of our loved ones should something happen to us. SuryaJyotiLife however, is making an attempt to move away from that notion by providing the financial and psychological support at the time of need to our policyholders.
Our objective is to stand and fight the dreadful disease with our policyholders and ensure they fully enjoy their life and an insurance policy that they may have to till their old age. Within a very short span of time since the operation, we, SuryaJyotiLife take pride in ensuring almost 20,000 lives impacting a countless number of dependents and family members directly or indirectly.
The benefit under this rider is payable as per the terms and conditions of policy documents, rider documents or any endorsement attached in the policy.
